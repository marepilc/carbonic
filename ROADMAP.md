    - DateTime methods: today(), tomorrow(), yesterday(), next(unit, count, tz), previous(unit, count, tz)
    - Convenience functions: today(), tomorrow(), yesterday() for easy imports
    - Supported units: second, minute, hour, day, week, month, quarter, year
    - Type-safe design: Proper validation and error messages for invalid units
    - No localization issues: Function-based approach avoids natural language parsing complexity (31 comprehensive tests)
  - Pydantic Integration: Complete validation and serialization field types

  ðŸ”„ Remaining Major Features

  3. Data Library Integrations

  âœ… Performance Optimizations (COMPLETED)

  - **Optional ciso8601**: Fast ISO datetime parsing acceleration with graceful fallback
  - **Memory optimizations**: Efficient slots usage across all core classes
  - **Lazy evaluation**: Cached expensive formatting operations (locale lookups, timezone formatting)

  âœ… Additional Locale Support (COMPLETED)

  - **Spanish locale**: Complete Spanish localization with decimal comma formatting, proper pluralization, and full month/day names
  - **French locale**: Complete French localization with decimal comma formatting, proper pluralization, and full month/day names
  - **German locale**: Complete German localization with decimal comma formatting, proper pluralization, and full month/day names
  - **Portuguese locale**: Complete Portuguese localization with decimal comma formatting, proper pluralization, and full month/day names
  - Expandable architecture: Easy addition of new locales following established patterns across 6 languages

  5. Additional Parsing Features

  - More format support: RFC 2822, custom business formats
  - Enhanced format detection and validation

  1. Holiday Support (Future Enhancement)

  - Holiday calendar integration: Custom holiday lists for business day calculations
  - Regional holiday support: Built-in holidays for major regions (US, EU, etc.)
  - Holiday-aware business day methods: add_business_days(days, holidays=[])

  ðŸŽ¯ Suggested Next Priority

  Based on the current completion status with performance optimizations, relative date functions, Pydantic integration, and comprehensive locale support now complete, the recommended development order is:

  1. **Additional Parsing Features** - More format support (RFC 2822, custom business formats)
  2. **Holiday Support** - Holiday calendar integration for business day calculations

  ## Current Status Summary

  **âœ… Core Foundation Complete:**
  - All major datetime classes (Date, DateTime, Duration, Period, Interval)
  - Complete arithmetic, comparison, and anchor operations
  - ISO 8601 parsing and Carbon-style formatting
  - Business day arithmetic with weekend handling
  - Duration humanization with configurable output
  - **Comprehensive Localization System: English, Polish, Spanish, French, German, and Portuguese support**
  - **Comprehensive i18n infrastructure with proper grammar handling and expandable architecture**
  - Comprehensive timezone handling with stdlib integration
  - Full type safety with precise overloads
  - **Polars Plugin Architecture: Complete foundation for high-performance external integrations**
  - **Performance Optimizations: Fast ISO parsing (ciso8601), memory efficiency (slots), lazy evaluation (formatting cache)**
  - **Pydantic Integration: Complete validation and serialization field types with optional dependency support**

  **ðŸ”„ Next Phase:** Focus on additional parsing features and holiday support, then prepare for external data library integrations as separate repositories to maintain clean separation of concerns.
