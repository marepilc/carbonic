Completed

  - Core Classes: Date, DateTime, Duration (fully implemented with TDD)
  - Duration Integration: Complete diff() and arithmetic operations
  - Parsing & Formatting: ISO strict/relaxed, Carbon-style tokens, auto-detection
  - Timezone Handling: Full ZoneInfo support with proper UTC defaults
  - Comparison & Arithmetic: Comprehensive operators for all core classes
  - Anchor Methods: start_of/end_of for various time periods

  ðŸ”„ Remaining Major Features

  1. Period/Interval Classes

  - Period Class: Named periods (Day, Week, Month, Quarter, Year) for semantic operations
  - Interval Class: Time intervals with start/end points and operations like overlap, contains, union
  - These would enable operations like Period.MONTH.add_to(date) or interval1.overlaps(interval2)

  2. Enhanced Duration Features

  - Duration.parse(): Parse ISO 8601 duration strings (P1Y2M3DT4H5M6S)
  - Duration.humanize(): Localized human-readable output ("2 days ago", "in 3 hours")
  - More sophisticated calendar arithmetic (business days, weekends)

  3. Localization System

  - CLDR-style localization: Polish and English first, expandable architecture
  - Localized formatting: Month/day names, relative time phrases
  - Number formatting: Different decimal separators, digit grouping
  - Humanization: "2 dni temu" vs "2 days ago"

  4. Data Library Integrations

  - Pandas adapters: DataFrame datetime operations, custom dtypes
  - Polars adapters: Lazy evaluation compatibility
  - Pydantic field types: Validation and serialization support

  5. Performance Optimizations

  - Optional ciso8601: Fast ISO datetime parsing acceleration
  - Memory optimizations: More efficient slots usage
  - Lazy evaluation: Expensive formatting operations

  6. Additional Parsing Features

  - Relative parsing: "tomorrow", "next week", "last month"
  - Natural language: "in 2 hours", "3 days ago"
  - More format support: RFC 2822, custom business formats

  ðŸŽ¯ Suggested Next Priority

  Based on the Carbon PHP inspiration and typical datetime library usage, I'd suggest this order:

  1. Period Class - High-impact semantic operations that users expect
  2. Duration.parse() - Complete the Duration API with ISO 8601 support
  3. Basic Localization - Polish/English humanization for Duration
  4. Interval Class - Advanced time range operations
  5. Data Library Integrations - Expand ecosystem compatibility

  The Period Class would be particularly valuable as it provides intuitive operations like:

  # Instead of manual date arithmetic
  next_month = date.add(months=1)

  # Semantic operations
  next_month = Period.MONTH.add_to(date)
  quarter_start = Period.QUARTER.start_of(date)
