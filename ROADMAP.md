  - Type Safety: Precise overloads for better IDE support and type checking

  - Relative Date/Time Functions: Clean function-based API for relative date operations
    - Date methods: today(), tomorrow(), yesterday(), next(unit, count), previous(unit, count)
    - DateTime methods: today(), tomorrow(), yesterday(), next(unit, count, tz), previous(unit, count, tz)
    - Convenience functions: today(), tomorrow(), yesterday() for easy imports
    - Supported units: second, minute, hour, day, week, month, quarter, year
    - Type-safe design: Proper validation and error messages for invalid units
    - No localization issues: Function-based approach avoids natural language parsing complexity (31 comprehensive tests)

  ðŸ”„ Remaining Major Features

  3. Data Library Integrations

  - **carbonic-pandas**: DataFrame datetime operations, custom dtypes (future external repository)
  - **carbonic-pydantic**: Validation and serialization field types (optional dependency)
    - Pydantic field types for Date, DateTime, Duration validation
    - JSON serialization/deserialization support
    - Custom validators for date ranges and business rules
    - Available as `pip install carbonic[pydantic]` optional dependency

  âœ… Performance Optimizations (COMPLETED)

  - **Optional ciso8601**: Fast ISO datetime parsing acceleration with graceful fallback
  - **Memory optimizations**: Efficient slots usage across all core classes
  - **Lazy evaluation**: Cached expensive formatting operations (locale lookups, timezone formatting)

  4. Additional Locale Support

  - **Spanish locale**: Month/day names, pluralization rules, number formatting
  - **French locale**: Month/day names with gender agreement, pluralization, decimal formatting
  - **German locale**: Month/day names with case declension, compound time expressions
  - **Portuguese locale**: Month/day names, Brazilian/European variants, pluralization
  - Expandable architecture: Easy addition of new locales following established English/Polish patterns

  5. Additional Parsing Features

  - More format support: RFC 2822, custom business formats
  - Enhanced format detection and validation

  1. Holiday Support (Future Enhancement)

  - Holiday calendar integration: Custom holiday lists for business day calculations
  - Regional holiday support: Built-in holidays for major regions (US, EU, etc.)
  - Holiday-aware business day methods: add_business_days(days, holidays=[])

  ðŸŽ¯ Suggested Next Priority

  Based on the current completion status with performance optimizations and relative date functions now complete, the recommended development order is:

  1. **pydantic Integration** - Validation and serialization field types as optional dependency
  2. **Additional Locale Support** - Spanish, French, German, Portuguese localization
  3. **Additional Parsing Features** - More format support (RFC 2822, custom business formats)
  4. **Holiday Support** - Holiday calendar integration for business day calculations

  ## Current Status Summary

  **âœ… Core Foundation Complete:**
  - All major datetime classes (Date, DateTime, Duration, Period, Interval)
  - Complete arithmetic, comparison, and anchor operations
  - ISO 8601 parsing and Carbon-style formatting
  - Business day arithmetic with weekend handling
  - Duration humanization with configurable output
  - **Localization system with English and Polish support**
  - **Comprehensive i18n infrastructure with proper grammar handling**
  - Comprehensive timezone handling with stdlib integration
  - Full type safety with precise overloads
  - **Polars Plugin Architecture: Complete foundation for high-performance external integrations**
  - **Performance Optimizations: Fast ISO parsing (ciso8601), memory efficiency (slots), lazy evaluation (formatting cache)**

  **ðŸ”„ Next Phase:** Focus on additional parsing features and locale support, then prepare for external data library integrations as separate repositories to maintain clean separation of concerns.
