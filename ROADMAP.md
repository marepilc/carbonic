âœ… Completed

  - Core Classes: Date, DateTime, Duration (fully implemented with TDD)
  - Duration Integration: Complete diff() and arithmetic operations
  - Enhanced Duration API:
    - Renamed storage property: `seconds` â†’ `storage_seconds` for clarity
    - Converted `in_*` properties to methods with `whole: bool` parameter
    - Precise type overloads for `int | float` returns based on `whole` parameter
  - Enhanced Subtraction Operators:
    - Date - Date â†’ Duration (automatic type inference)
    - DateTime - DateTime â†’ Duration (with timezone awareness)
    - Maintains backward compatibility with Duration subtraction
  - Period Class: Named period constants with semantic operations
    - Constants: MINUTE, HOUR, DAY, WEEK, MONTH, QUARTER, YEAR
    - Methods: add_to(), subtract_from(), start_of(), end_of()
    - Smart validation: Prevents invalid operations (minutes on Date)
    - Clean type safety with ClassVar declarations (35 comprehensive tests)
  - Parsing & Formatting: ISO strict/relaxed, Carbon-style tokens, auto-detection
  - Timezone Handling: Full ZoneInfo support with proper UTC defaults
  - Comparison & Arithmetic: Comprehensive operators for all core classes
  - Anchor Methods: start_of/end_of for various time periods
  - Type Safety: Precise overloads for better IDE support and type checking

  ðŸ”„ Remaining Major Features

  1. Interval Class

  - Interval Class: Time intervals with start/end points and operations like overlap, contains, union
  - These would enable operations like interval1.overlaps(interval2), interval.contains(date)

  2. Enhanced Duration Features

  - Duration.parse(): Parse ISO 8601 duration strings (P1Y2M3DT4H5M6S)
  - Duration.humanize(): Localized human-readable output ("2 days ago", "in 3 hours")
  - More sophisticated calendar arithmetic (business days, weekends)

  3. Localization System

  - CLDR-style localization: Polish and English first, expandable architecture
  - Localized formatting: Month/day names, relative time phrases
  - Number formatting: Different decimal separators, digit grouping
  - Humanization: "2 dni temu" vs "2 days ago"

  4. Data Library Integrations

  - Pandas adapters: DataFrame datetime operations, custom dtypes
  - Polars adapters: Lazy evaluation compatibility
  - Pydantic field types: Validation and serialization support

  5. Performance Optimizations

  - Optional ciso8601: Fast ISO datetime parsing acceleration
  - Memory optimizations: More efficient slots usage
  - Lazy evaluation: Expensive formatting operations

  6. Additional Parsing Features

  - Relative parsing: "tomorrow", "next week", "last month"
  - Natural language: "in 2 hours", "3 days ago"
  - More format support: RFC 2822, custom business formats

  ðŸŽ¯ Suggested Next Priority

  Based on the Carbon PHP inspiration and typical datetime library usage, I'd suggest this order:

  1. Interval Class - Time range operations (overlaps, contains, union, intersection)
  2. Duration.parse() - Complete the Duration API with ISO 8601 support
  3. Basic Localization - Polish/English humanization for Duration
  4. Data Library Integrations - Expand ecosystem compatibility

  The Interval Class would provide valuable operations like:

  ```python
  # Time range operations
  meeting = Interval(start=DateTime(2024, 1, 15, 9, 0), end=DateTime(2024, 1, 15, 10, 30))
  lunch = Interval(start=DateTime(2024, 1, 15, 12, 0), end=DateTime(2024, 1, 15, 13, 0))

  meeting.overlaps(lunch)           # False
  meeting.contains(DateTime(2024, 1, 15, 9, 30))  # True
  meeting.union(lunch)              # Combined interval or list
  meeting.duration()                # Duration of the interval
  ```
