    - Localized Duration.humanize(): Smart pluralization ("2 dni", "5 sekund", "1 tydzieÅ„")
    - Localized Date/DateTime formatting: Month and day names with locale parameter support
    - Number formatting: Decimal comma for Polish, decimal point for English
    - Grammar conflict resolution: Smart week/day display based on pluralization context
    - Public API: get_locale(), register_locale(), is_locale_available() (25 comprehensive tests)

    - Duration.parse(): Complete ISO 8601 duration string parsing (P1Y2M3DT4H5M6S)
    - Support for all ISO 8601 formats: full, date-only, time-only, weeks, fractional components
    - Negative duration support, case-insensitive parsing, comprehensive error handling
    - Full type safety with proper fractional component conversion (14 comprehensive tests)
    - Duration.humanize(): Human-readable duration formatting with localization support
    - Smart unit selection: "2 days 3 hours", "1 week", "0.5 seconds" with proper pluralization
    - Configurable max_units, negative duration handling, fractional seconds precision
    - Calendar component priority (years/months first), locale framework ready (13 comprehensive tests)
  - Calendar Arithmetic: Complete business day and weekend handling
    - is_weekday(), is_weekend(): Weekend/weekday detection methods
    - add_business_days(), subtract_business_days(): Business day arithmetic with weekend skipping
    - Smart weekend handling: Auto-moves to nearest business day when starting on weekend
    - Boundary crossing: Works across months/years, optimized for large numbers (14 comprehensive tests)
  - Parsing & Formatting: ISO strict/relaxed, Carbon-style tokens, auto-detection
  - Timezone Handling: Full ZoneInfo support with proper UTC defaults
  - Comparison & Arithmetic: Comprehensive operators for all core classes
  - Anchor Methods: start_of/end_of for various time periods
  - Type Safety: Precise overloads for better IDE support and type checking

  ðŸ”„ Remaining Major Features

  3. Data Library Integrations

  - Pandas adapters: DataFrame datetime operations, custom dtypes
  - Polars adapters: Lazy evaluation compatibility
  - Pydantic field types: Validation and serialization support

  4. Performance Optimizations

  - Optional ciso8601: Fast ISO datetime parsing acceleration
  - Memory optimizations: More efficient slots usage
  - Lazy evaluation: Expensive formatting operations

  5. Additional Locale Support (Post Performance)

  - Spanish locale: Complex verb conjugation support for relative phrases
  - French locale: Gender agreement for month/day names, liaison rules
  - German locale: Case declension support, compound time expressions
  - Expandable architecture: Easy addition of new locales following established patterns

  6. Additional Parsing Features

  - Relative parsing: "tomorrow", "next week", "last month"
  - Natural language: "in 2 hours", "3 days ago"
  - More format support: RFC 2822, custom business formats

  7. Holiday Support (Future Enhancement)

  - Holiday calendar integration: Custom holiday lists for business day calculations
  - Regional holiday support: Built-in holidays for major regions (US, EU, etc.)
  - Holiday-aware business day methods: add_business_days(days, holidays=[])

  ðŸŽ¯ Suggested Next Priority

  Based on the current completion status and typical datetime library usage patterns, the recommended development order is:

  1. **Data Library Integrations** - Pandas/Polars adapters for ecosystem compatibility
  2. **Performance Optimizations** - Optional ciso8601 for faster parsing acceleration
  3. **Additional Locale Support** - Spanish, French, German localization (post-performance)
  4. **Additional Parsing Features** - Natural language and relative date parsing
